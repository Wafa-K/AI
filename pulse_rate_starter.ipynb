    "> - **Code Description** - Include details so someone unfamiliar with your project will know how to run your code and use your algorithm. \n",
    "> - **Data Description** - Describe the dataset that was used to train and test the algorithm. Include its short-comings and what data would be required to build a more complete dataset.\n",
    "> - **Algorithhm Description** will include the following:\n",
    ">   - how the algorithm works\n",
    ">   - the specific aspects of the physiology that it takes advantage of\n",
    ">   - a describtion of the algorithm outputs\n",
    ">   - caveats on algorithm outputs \n",
    ">   - common failure modes\n",
    "> - **Algorithm Performance** - Detail how performance was computed (eg. using cross-validation or train-test split) and what metrics were optimized for. Include error metrics that would be relevant to users of your algorithm. Caveat your performance numbers by acknowledging how generalizable they may or may not be on different datasets.\n",
